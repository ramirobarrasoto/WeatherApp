# WeatherApp

Hello, this was my first application and I want to share it with you.

This is an application built with React that collects data from the accuweather API and processes it into cards created with CSS and bootstrap. If you click, the name of each card will direct you to a detail card where you can learn more about the weather in that city. You should also check the 'About' section, with information about me and my social networks. I hope you like it!

Special thanks to Lucila Rossi for the background picture

In this app you can search the weather of all the cities you want, in mobile or desktop mode
